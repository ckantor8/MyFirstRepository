<p>One of the most pressing issues in America today is the ever-worsening opioid epidemic. Despite the overall national opioid prescribing rate falling in 2016 to the lowest it had been 10 years, the frequency of opioid-related overdoses continue to climb. Though, as you can see from this 
    <a href="opioid_map.jpg">geographic map of opioid deaths,</a> they are not equally distributed throughout the nation. So in order to further investigate this crisis and what causes it to be more prevalent in particular regions, I plan to compile data on the 
    <a href="data.html">next page.</a></p>

    <tr>
        <th>Year</th>
        <th>Number</th>
        <th>Deaths per 100k</th>
    </tr>

        <td>2012</td>
