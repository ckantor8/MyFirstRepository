<h1>Data on The Opioid Epidemic</h1>

<h2>With Particular Focus on Geographic Distribution</h2>

<p>I am very interested in the data collected by federal agencies, such as
<a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis">the NIH, </a>
<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html">the USDHHS, </a>
<a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/opioids">the HRSA,</a> 
and many other institutions, on not only opioid abuse and overdoses, but also on opioid prescription,
particularly with respect to geographical distribution of the data.
I would like to do my project on this dataset because
the opioid epidemic, which has taken multiple friends of mine, 
is one of America's most pressing health issues today, so I would like to learn more about it as well as teach others.
Additionally, I imagine that there is abundant data from plenty of sources, such as The Economist article linked in the infographic below.</p>
